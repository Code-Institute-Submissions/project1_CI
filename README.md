# Project Cineward
This is a static website for a video productions company. The website is a "onepager", which means all information is on the same page. There is a navbar, so you can easily go to the part of the website you are looking for. An important feature of the website is that it contains many videos, in particular to showcase the videos the company has made (portfolio). These videos are all embedded as Youtube videos. In order to not drains a user's data package the videos will only load if he or she wants to play the video. 
The website is made so that it is responsive. Both on pc's, pads and mobiles the website maintains all its functionality. 

## UX 
The website is built with the aim of giving a clear overview of what the company does, its previous work, and how to contact them. The assumption is that these are the most important questions that potential buyers will have. 
There are many videos of previous work that can be viewed on the website. The choice was to embed videos as Youtube urls that will only load if the user clicks on the video. Video stills are used as a background image for the videos. A "play" button is placed on top of that, so that the user knows its a video. The main arguments for presenting the videos like this is that the users data is not drained and that the videos can be viewed nicely on the website (also on mobile) with the help of the Lity library. 
Furthermore, personal photos and stories of the owner of the company were used in order to built a trust relationship with the user of the website. 
Although this project uses bootstrap for its layout, the styling is done completely in css. Thus, no theme is used. The design was created from the staring point that it should be calm and clear. 

## Built with
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap
5. Lity

## Features
* Mobile responsive - This website is scales perfectly and doesn't lose any of its functionality on smaller screens. 
* Fixed navbar - The fixed navbar helps user navigation, in particular on smaller screens. 
* Portfolio with select function - The portfolio shows stills of the video before playing with a short informative text. Also, there are buttons added that will select only videos of a particular genre. This will be especially helpful when there are many videos added. 
* Contact form - Users can fill in an email on the website. This will make them more likely to contact the company. 
* Call button in the navbar - People can call the company with one click

###### Features left to implement
* scss file - Creating a scss file will make it more easy to switch from theme or to add new html pages in the same style.
